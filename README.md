A quick and dirty script to count citations of a list of publications.

Requires a PDF file that contains a list of properly formatted publications [authors. title. year. jounral. Whatever.]. Also requires the user to generate an Elsevier API key, which can be done [here](https://dev.elsevier.com/).

Not designed to be too generalised. Specifically made for myself for pure curiosity, but feel free to take and adapt.
